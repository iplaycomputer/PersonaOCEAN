Summary of Findings

- All core claims in README and docs are supported by peer-reviewed sources.
- The inverted-U (TMGT) framing for teamwork-related traits is well represented by Curșeu et al. (2018) and consistent with complementary management literature.
- Big Five foundations, measurement, and team-performance relationships have adequate coverage and triangulation.
- Ethics and limitations are clearly disclosed, matching responsible open-source use.

Notes

- Items without DOIs (books/manuals) are marked as “book, ISBN verified” in internal notes.
- Curșeu et al. (2018) article DOI (10.1002/ijop.12511) commonly appears with 2019 pagination; this is reconciled here under 2019 DOI formatting.

Full Verification Report

Purpose
This verification was conducted to ensure reproducibility and transparency of all cited sources in the PersonaOCEAN framework.

All forty-one citations listed in the PersonaOCEAN Scientific Framework were independently verified using publicly available academic databases (APA PsycArticles, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, Taylor & Francis, and Google Scholar).

Verification process

* Each source was checked for correct author names, year, title, and publication outlet.
* DOIs were resolved to confirm existence and peer-reviewed status.
* Books and manuals without DOIs were confirmed through ISBN listings in publisher or library catalogs.
* Minor metadata differences (e.g., Curșeu et al. 2018 → 2019; Kaiser et al. 2013 → 2015) were corrected to match current publisher records.

Findings

* All 41 references verified.
* Two minor year corrections; all others accurate.
* DOIs and ISBNs validated and publicly resolvable.
* Every item comes from a legitimate scholarly or professional publication.

Conclusion
The verification confirms that the PersonaOCEAN framework is fully grounded in verifiable, peer-reviewed research. No unverifiable or fabricated references were identified. This file serves as the official transparency and provenance record for PersonaOCEAN v1.1 and subsequent versions.
