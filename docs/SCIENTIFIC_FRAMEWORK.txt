## How PersonaOCEAN uses this research

PersonaOCEAN turns simple Big Five (OCEAN) inputs into practical, team-friendly insights using transparent math and a readable taxonomy. Inputs are provided on a common 0–120 scale and normalized to −1..+1 using a linear transform. Each archetype in `roles.yaml` is defined by a five-weight pattern (also −1..+1). Matching uses a dot product between the normalized trait vector and each role’s pattern; the role with the highest score is returned alongside its department and a brief description. This keeps the model fast, interpretable, and easy to audit.

For team-level analytics, PersonaOCEAN aggregates members’ scores and reports a concise snapshot: top roles, department mix, average trait levels, and a “vibe” summary. In detailed mode, the bot displays normalized values and percentile-style bars for each trait, plus a compact balance line highlighting the most pronounced and most muted traits. These views are meant to help teams discuss distribution and complementarity, not to label or limit individuals.

To better reflect real organizational behavior, PersonaOCEAN incorporates a non-linear “Teamwork Fit” index inspired by Curşeu et al. (2018) and the broader TMGT literature: performance on some traits follows an inverted U (too low is harmful, too high can also be counterproductive). We approximate this with a smooth inverted-U function over the team’s mean Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, then make small, transparent adjustments for Stability (lower Neuroticism) and balanced Openness. The resulting index (0–1) and a plain-language label are included in detailed summaries to encourage nuanced interpretation.

Important limitations and ethics: PersonaOCEAN is not a clinical or high-stakes assessment. It does not attempt facet-level precision and relies on self-reported inputs. Results are intended for conversation and exploration only. Data are kept in memory per server and not persisted; the role taxonomy and matching math are fully visible in the repository to support scrutiny and improvement. Please avoid using outputs for hiring, promotion, or other consequential decisions without qualified validation and oversight.

Versioned assumptions: The current implementation uses linear normalization, role templates at the domain level (not facets), a dot-product matcher, and a simple inverted-U approximation for teamwork. These choices are deliberately conservative and open to revision as the taxonomy matures, facet support is added, or empirical weights become available.
